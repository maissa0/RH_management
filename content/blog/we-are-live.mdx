## The Journey Begins

Hey there! I'm Rayen, and I'm super excited to share some big news with you. Today marks the official launch of cruxhire.com 1.0, and honestly, it feels a bit surreal typing these words.

Like many of you, I've been through countless job interviews. Those late-night preparation sessions, the anxiety before important discussions, and that familiar feeling of "Am I really ready for this?" We've all been there, right?

## Why We Built cruxhire.com

The job interview process can be overwhelming, especially for those early in their careers. Between preparing your responses, researching companies, and practicing common interview questions, it's easy to feel lost. That's exactly why we created cruxhire.com.
