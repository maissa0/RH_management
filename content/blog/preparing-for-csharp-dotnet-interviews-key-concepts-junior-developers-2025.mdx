## Understanding C# Fundamentals

Before diving into complex topics, let's establish a solid foundation of C# basics that interviewers often focus on.

### Value Types vs Reference Types

One of the most fundamental concepts in C# is understanding how different types store and manage data. Here's what you need to know:

**Value Types (Stored on Stack)**

- Include: int, double, bool, struct
- Contain the actual data
- Faster access
- Copied when assigned

**Reference Types (Stored on Heap)**

- Include: class, interface, delegate, string
- Contain a reference to the data
- More flexible but slightly slower
- Share references when assigned

Think of it like this:
- **Value Types** are like writing a number on a sticky note. When you share it, you make a copy of the note. Changes to one note don't affect the other.
- **Reference Types** are like sharing a Google Doc link. Everyone with the link sees the same document, and changes by one person affect everyone.


Here's a practical example that interviewers love to discuss:

```csharp
public class TypesExample
{
    // Value types - stored directly on the stack
    private readonly int age = 25;                    // Simple value type
    private readonly DateTime birthDate = DateTime.Now; // Struct (value type)

    // Reference types - stored on the heap
    private readonly string name = "John";            // Immutable reference type
    private readonly List<int> scores = new();        // Mutable reference type

    public void DemonstrateValueVsReference()
    {
        // Value type copying
        int x = 10;
        int y = x;     // Creates a new copy
        y = 20;        // x is still 10

        // Reference type sharing
        var list1 = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
        var list2 = list1;  // Both point to same list
        list2.Add(4);       // Both lists now have 4
    }
}
```

### Memory Management Essentials

As a junior developer, understanding how .NET manages memory is crucial. Here's what you should focus on:

1. **Garbage Collection Basics**

- The GC automatically manages memory
- Objects are collected when no longer referenced
- Runs in generations (0, 1, and 2)

2. **Resource Management**
   The `IDisposable` pattern is essential for managing unmanaged resources. Here's a proper implementation:

```csharp
public class DatabaseConnection : IDisposable
{
    private bool isDisposed;
    private readonly SqlConnection _connection;

    public DatabaseConnection(string connectionString)
    {
        _connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
    }

    public void OpenConnection()
    {
        ThrowIfDisposed();
        _connection.Open();
    }

    private void ThrowIfDisposed()
    {
        if (isDisposed)
            throw new ObjectDisposedException(nameof(DatabaseConnection));
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (!isDisposed)
        {
            _connection?.Dispose();
            isDisposed = true;
        }
    }
}

// Proper usage with using statement
public async Task UseConnectionAsync()
{
    await using var db = new DatabaseConnection("connection_string");
    await db.OpenConnection();
    // Work with connection
} // Automatically disposed here
```
Think of .NET's garbage collection like a smart cleaning service:
- Your apartment (memory) has rooms (objects)
- The cleaning service (garbage collector) checks each room
- Rooms with no way to reach them (unreferenced objects) get cleaned
- Frequently used rooms (Gen 0) get checked more often than storage rooms (Gen 2)

## Object-Oriented Programming

OOP is a cornerstone of C# development. Here are the key concepts you'll need to master:

### SOLID Principles in Practice

Let's break down each principle with real-world examples:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. Here's a practical example:

```csharp
// Bad Example - Too many responsibilities
public class UserService
{
    public void CreateUser(User user) { /* ... */ }
    public void SendEmail(string to, string subject) { /* ... */ }
    public void SaveToDatabase(User user) { /* ... */ }
}

// Good Example - Separated responsibilities
public class UserService
{
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;

    public UserService(
        IEmailService emailService,
        IUserRepository userRepository)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
        _userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public async Task CreateUserAsync(User user)
    {
        await _userRepository.SaveAsync(user);
        await _emailService.SendWelcomeEmailAsync(user.Email);
    }
}
```

## Understanding Async/Await in C#

Asynchronous programming is one of the most important concepts in modern C# development. Let's break it down in simple terms.

### What is Async Programming?

Think of async programming like ordering coffee at a busy caf√©:

1. You place your order (start an async operation)
2. Instead of waiting, you find a seat (continue other work)
3. The barista calls your name when ready (operation completes)

### Key Concepts to Know

1. **Task vs Thread**

   - Tasks are high-level operations
   - Threads are system-level resources
   - Tasks can use multiple threads or no threads at all

2. **async/await Keywords**
   - `async` marks a method as asynchronous
   - `await` pauses execution until an operation completes
   - The method continues from that point when ready

### Common Interview Questions

Here are patterns you'll likely be asked about:

```csharp
public class AsyncPatterns
{
    // Basic async/await pattern
    public async Task<string> GetUserDataAsync(int userId)
    {
        try
        {
            // Simulating an API call
            await Task.Delay(100); // In real code, this would be a DB or API call
            return $"User data for {userId}";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Error fetching user data");
            throw;
        }
    }

    // Handling multiple async operations
    public async Task<DashboardData> LoadDashboardAsync()
    {
        try
        {
            // Start all operations at once
            var userTask = GetUserDataAsync(1);
            var ordersTask = GetOrdersAsync();
            var analyticsTask = GetAnalyticsAsync();

            // Wait for all to complete
            await Task.WhenAll(userTask, ordersTask, analyticsTask);

            return new DashboardData(
                await userTask,
                await ordersTask,
                await analyticsTask
            );
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Dashboard load failed");
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<Callout type="warning">
  Interviewers often look for these common async/await mistakes. Make sure you
  understand them!
</Callout>

1. **Deadlocks**

```csharp
// BAD: This can deadlock
public string GetDataWrong()
{
    return Task.Run(async () =>
        await GetDataAsync()).Result; // Never use .Result or .Wait()
}

// GOOD: Always use async all the way
public async Task<string> GetDataRight()
{
    return await GetDataAsync();
}
```

2. **Exception Handling**

```csharp
public class AsyncExceptionHandling
{
    // BAD: Lost exception context
    public async Task BadExceptionHandling()
    {
        try
        {
            await Task.FromException(new Exception("Error"));
        }
        catch
        {
            throw new Exception("Something went wrong"); // Loses stack trace
        }
    }

    // GOOD: Preserves exception context
    public async Task GoodExceptionHandling()
    {
        try
        {
            await Task.FromException(new Exception("Error"));
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Operation failed");
            throw; // Preserves stack trace
        }
    }
}
```

### Best Practices Checklist

```markdown
## Async/Await Best Practices

- [ ] Always use async/await instead of Task.Result or Task.Wait()
- [ ] Name async methods with 'Async' suffix
- [ ] Handle exceptions properly with try/catch
- [ ] Use cancellation tokens for long-running operations
- [ ] Avoid mixing async and sync code
- [ ] Remember that async void is dangerous (except for event handlers)
```

### Real-World Example

Here's a practical example you might discuss in an interview:

```csharp
public class OrderProcessor
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;
    private readonly ILogger<OrderProcessor> _logger;

    public OrderProcessor(
        IOrderRepository orderRepository,
        IEmailService emailService,
        ILogger<OrderProcessor> logger)
    {
        _orderRepository = orderRepository;
        _emailService = emailService;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task<ProcessResult> ProcessOrderAsync(
        Order order,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        try
        {
            // Validate order
            if (!await ValidateOrderAsync(order))
                return ProcessResult.Failed("Invalid order");

            // Process payment and save order concurrently
            var paymentTask = ProcessPaymentAsync(order.Payment);
            var saveTask = _orderRepository.SaveAsync(order);

            // Wait for both operations
            await Task.WhenAll(paymentTask, saveTask);

            // Send confirmation email
            await _emailService.SendOrderConfirmationAsync(
                order.CustomerEmail,
                order.OrderNumber
            );

            return ProcessResult.Success();
        }
        catch (Exception ex) when (ex is not OperationCanceledException)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Order processing failed");
            return ProcessResult.Failed(ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```
